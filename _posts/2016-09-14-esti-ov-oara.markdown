A few months ago, I saw the web project [-ach, -ingen,
-zell](http://truth-and-beauty.net/experiments/ach-ingen-zell/), an interactive
visualization of German town suffixes and their distribution across Germany.
*-ești, -ov, -oara* is a version for Romania.

The suffixes were chosen in consultation with
[@sarnthil](https://twitter.com/sarnthil), and are (like in the original)
pretty arbitrary, since no morphological analysis is being done; we're just
looking at the raw endings.

The result can be found
